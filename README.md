<h1>Susurrus: Accessible Data Representation with Natural Sound</h1>
<h4>ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (ACM CHI), 2023</h4>
This is a testbed for Susurrus, a sonification technique for representing data visualization with natural sounds.
To run this repository, first install the packages in app.py.
Then, run the codebase in localhost and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/create_sound .
We have created a testbed for creating bar and line charts using susrrus.
This version uses volume for controlling loudness. However, in the user study we used LUFS.
